# gh command extensions

_EXPERIMENTAL_

This repository contains my custom commands for the GitHub CLI.

To try this out, you will need a development version of `gh` with [command extensions support](https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/1037). Then:

```
gh repo clone mislav/gh-commands ~/.config/gh/gh-commands/mislav
```
